Simple interrupt annoncer for pve encounters compatible with 3.3.5. It's heavily based on a similiar addon called Pare! Interrupt (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/pare) which had no support for 3.3.5. So I made a compatible version myself. And in the process, I also changed the goal of the addon.

The addon aims at tracking any spell-interrupt made by a player against an NPC while in raid group.

The syntax used:

"Interruption OF XXX made on YYY with AAA BY ZZZ"

XXX = target cast name (link)
YYY = target name
ZZZ = source name
AAA = source interrupter name
